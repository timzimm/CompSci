## How to get it?
Since a submodule is involved, please run:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/timzimm/CompSci.git
```

## What is it about?
Abstract goes in here once written

## What's in the box?
**src/**: contains all implementation files (*.py) and jupyter notebooks used
for the analysis and plot generation for the report.

**doc/**: git submodule to the overleaf repo hosting the report

**config/**: configuration files. Contains conda environment description (TBA)

**misc/**: whatever doesn't fit into the above, goes in here.

## What's not in the box? 
Several dependencies are required:
- numpy
- pytorch
- ray tune
- matplotlib/seaborn

Please make sure that all dependcies are installed in your local python (3)
environment. For convenience, we provide a conda environment file (TBA) to speed up the 
process of getting started.
